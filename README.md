# FruityTooty

This project will be based around nutrition and fruits specifically and the various information that can be obtained from the api. 
So for this project, we’ll Include fruit infomation such as calories, what its name is, what Family and Genus it belongs to among other things. 

The challenges that might⁄ come up are Unexpected errors and having to work through that, along with bringing together all of the functionality of the site and making it work. 

Core features of this site are that once a button is clicked, it would indicate that I liked the fruit and save it.
Also, you can click a button and indicate that you do not like that specific fruit and want it to be removed from the page. 
Finally, you would be able to see all of the fruits and the nutrition information in the database/JSON object when the page is refreshed.
